# Todos

  This project is a rewrite serverless version of the former MERN boilerplate project [todos-domain--serverful](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/todos-domain--serverful). Now the project is in production and deployed as [todos.quantumsnowball.ml](https://todos.quantumsnowball.ml). The main reason to rewrite this app is to convert the backend to serverless functions. Instead of relying on centralized servers, being serverless means distributing the backend api endpoints into pieces and run them as stateless functions, providing much bigger scaling potential for any apps. The rewrite version also make use of \`Next.js\` implementing server-side rendering (SSR), further enhancing the app experience.
